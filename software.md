## R packages

### [wiggleplotr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/wiggleplotr.html)

wiggleplotr is a Bioconductor package for making RNA-seq read coverage plots from BigWig files. A key advantage of wiggleplotr is that introns of long transcripts can be rescaled to a fixed length, enabling better visualisation of exonic read coverage.

### [txrevise](https://github.com/kauralasoo/txrevise)
txrevise is a tool to convert Ensembl transcript annotations into distinct sets of transcriptional events: alternative promoters, splicing events and alternative 3â€² ends. These event annotations can subsequently used to detect differences in transcript usage between biological conditions or identify transcript usage QTLs. Read more from the [paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41673.001) or the see the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kauralasoo/txrevise/blob/master/inst/doc/construct_events.html) for a worked out example. The pre-computed event annotations can be directly downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3232932) and our RNA-seq quantifcation pipeline ([kerimoff/rnaseq](https://github.com/kerimoff/rnaseq)) implements txrevise as one of the optional quantification methods.
