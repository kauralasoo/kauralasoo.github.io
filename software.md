## Analysis workflows

We are developing and maintaining a number of modular data analysis workflows for the [eQTL Catalogue](https://www.ebi.ac.uk/eqtl/) project.

* [eQTL-Catalogue/genimpute](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/genimpute) - genotype phasing and imputation
* [eQTL-Catalogue/rnaseq](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/rnaseq) - RNA-seq quantification
* [eQTL-Catalogue/qcnorm](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/qcnorm) - RNA-seq normalisation and quality control
* [eQTL-Catalogue/qtlmap](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/qtlmap) - eQTL analysis
* [eQTL-Catalogue/susie-workflow](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/susie-workflow) - statistical fine mapping

## R packages

### [wiggleplotr](https://bioconductor.org/packages/release/bioc/html/wiggleplotr.html)

wiggleplotr is a Bioconductor package for making RNA-seq read coverage plots from BigWig files. A key advantage of wiggleplotr is that introns of long transcripts can be rescaled to a fixed length, enabling better visualisation of exonic read coverage.

### [txrevise](https://github.com/kauralasoo/txrevise)
txrevise is a tool to convert Ensembl transcript annotations into distinct sets of transcriptional events: alternative promoters, splicing events and alternative 3â€² ends. These event annotations can subsequently used to detect differences in transcript usage between biological conditions or identify transcript usage QTLs. Read more from the [paper](https://doi.org/10.7554/eLife.41673.001) or the see the [vignette](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/kauralasoo/txrevise/blob/master/inst/doc/construct_events.html) for a worked out example. The pre-computed event annotations can be directly downloaded from [Zenodo](https://doi.org/10.5281/zenodo.3232932) and our RNA-seq quantifcation pipeline ([eQTL-Catalogue/rnaseq](https://github.com/eQTL-Catalogue/rnaseq)) implements txrevise as one of the optional quantification methods.
