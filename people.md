### Ralf Tambets
Ralf is a PhD student at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en). His current work focusses on detecting shared genetic signals across multiple traits using fine-mapping, colocalisation and Mendelian randomisation.

### Kristiina Kuningas
Kristiina obtained her Master's degree from the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en) and is currently a Data Analyst in the group. Kristiina works on uniform processing and quality control of large-scale chromatin QTL datasets. 

### Dzvenymyra-Marta (Dzvinka) Yarish
Dzvinka is a Master's student and a Machine Learing specialist in the group. She is interested in developing and using machine learing models to predict the effect of genetic variants on molecular traits such as chromatin accesibility, gene expression and splicing.

### Kaur Alasoo
Kaur is a Lecturer at the [Institute of Computer Science, University of Tartu](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en). He is interested in using diverse molecular datasets and computational models to decipher the mechanisms underlying complex traits and diseases. He is also quite proficient in applying for access to genomic datasets using dbGaP, EGA, Synapse, eDAM and other similar systems. Kaur completed his PhD in 2017 with [Daniel Gaffney](https://www.sanger.ac.uk/science/groups/gaffney-group) at the Wellcome Sanger Institute, where he studied the regulation of gene expression in macrophage immune response [(thesis)](https://www.repository.cam.ac.uk/handle/1810/263855). In 2020, he received the [Young IT Scientist Award](https://www.president.ee/et/vabariigi-president/institutsioonid/972-vabariigi-presidendi-kultuurirahastu/11698-noore-it-teadlase-eripreemia/layout-institution.html) from the President of Estonia. Since 2022, he is member of the [Estonian Young Academy of Sciences](https://www.akadeemia.ee/enta/).


## Alumni
### Ida Rahu (2022-2023)
Ida Rahu was a short-term post-doctoral fellow in the group. She studied genetic varaints regulating plasma metabolite levels in the Estonian Biobank and the UK Biobank. She is the main author of our [reGSusie](https://github.com/AlasooLab/reGSusie) GWAS analysis and fine mapping workflow that scales to hundreds of thousands of samples. 

### Kateryna Peikova (2020)
Kateryna was a MSc student at the [Institute of Computer Science](https://www.cs.ut.ee/en). Her [thesis](https://comserv.cs.ut.ee/ati_thesis/datasheet.php?id=70517&year=2020) focuses characterizing the patterens of eQTL sharing among the tissues and cell types present in the eQTL Catalogue. 

### Evelin Aasna (2018-2019)
In her [bacherlor's thesis](https://dspace.ut.ee/handle/10062/66518), Evelin used genetic approaches to study how factors regulating chromatin accessibility contribute to the control of RNA splicing.
